One of my last projects was to build the prototype [Unofficial Tapology API](https://rapidapi.com/YannAries/api/unofficial-tapology-api).<br>

I spent about six months developing the API and frontend which I self-fund, applying my knowledge of Python and learning all the components of RESTful API architecture, from caching to deployment. By January 2026 the API has 124 customers.

Traffic is gradually increasing by about 18% per month, with 10.9K API calls in the recent period. People are building data analytics projects with it, and they are the ones promoting it.

For now I don't have a roadmap. I listen to customers and adapt based on their feedback.
