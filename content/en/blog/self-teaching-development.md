After graduating from Collège Ahuntsic in Montreal, Canada and completing a 3-month internship at Libéo, I realized that formal education gave me the theory, but internships and self-teaching gave me the skills that actually matter in a professional environment.

### 1. Project-based learning

**What works best for me:** Pick a project, learn what I need when I need it.

**Example:**
- **Goal:** Build a portfolio site
- **Learned and refined:** Hugo, Git, Docker, deployment
- **Result:** You're looking at it

**This pushed me to learn:**
- Static site generators
- CDN infrastructure (Bunny Fonts, jsDelivr)
- Icon optimization (Simple Icons vs Font Awesome)
- Performance debugging

All skills I now use across various projects.

### 2. Documentation over courses

**My best approach:**
1. Read the official documentation first
2. Build something small
3. Break it, fix it, understand why
4. Move on to the next feature

**My go-to references:**
- [Hugo Docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) - Clear, searchable, up-to-date
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - The bible of web development
- [PostgreSQL Docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) - Better than any tutorial

### 3. Prioritize with the 80/20 Rule

No need to master everything — focus on the 20% that delivers 80% of results.

**My core stack:**
```
Essential:
├── Python
├── HTML5, CSS3, Advanced JavaScript
├── PostgreSQL
├── Git
└── Docker

Nice to have:
├── React or Vue
├── SSGs (Hugo)
├── Redis
├── AI/Cloud computing
└── CI/CD
```

## Resources I use

### For cloud computing and AI

I'm currently taking a cloud computing course covering AI and Machine Learning on Google Cloud on the edX online learning platform.

## Tools I use daily

### Development
- **VS Code + VS Codium** - Extensions: ESLint, GitLens, Prettier, Docker, ms-python, Nuxtr
- **Oh My Zsh** - Terminal productivity
- **Postman** - API testing
- **Valkey** - NoSQL database web interface

### Learning
- **Obsidian** - Notes
- **GitHub, Forgejo** - Online Git hosting service
- **Stack Overflow** - Q&A

### Deployment
- **Docker** - Containerization
- **Coolify** - Open-source self-hosting platform
- **Hetzner/OVH Cloud** - Cloud hosting
- **GitHub Actions/Forgejo Actions** - CI/CD

## Current focus

**This year:**
- [ ] Continue the cloud computing course
- [ ] Contribute to more open-source projects
- [ ] Scale my projects and grow MRR

## Conclusion

Self-teaching development isn't about following a perfect path. It taught me to:

1. **Building consistently** - Projects over tutorials
2. **Learn what matters** - using the 80/20 rule
3. **Step outside your comfort zone**
4. **Expand your professional network**
